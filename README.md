# 📚 Library Management System (C++ | OOP Project)

A simple and efficient **Library Management System** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in **C++**.  
This project automates core library operations such as managing books, members, issuing/returning books, and generating reports.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a functional and modular library management system that:

- Maintains book and member records  
- Handles book issue/return operations  
- Tracks book availability  
- Generates reports  
- Demonstrates OOP concepts in C++

---

## 📝 Problem Definition

Manual library management often results in:

- Inefficiency  
- Human error  
- Difficulty tracking availability  
- Increased chances of data loss  

To solve these issues, an automated system is required.

---

## 🚀 Proposed Solution

This Library Management System uses:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance** (Transaction → IssueRecord, ReturnRecord)
- **File Handling** to store all records in text files

The system supports:

- Adding, updating, deleting, and searching books  
- Registering and managing members  
- Issuing and returning books  
- Tracking book availability  
- Viewing reports  

---

## 🧩 Modules Overview

### **1️⃣ Book Module**
- Add new books  
- Update/Delete book records  
- Search books  
- Display all books  

### **2️⃣ Member Module**
- Register new members  
- Update member info  
- Manage member records  

### **3️⃣ Transaction Module**
- Issue books  
- Return books  
- Maintain transaction records  

### **4️⃣ Book Status Module**
- Track availability  
- Prevent duplicate issuing

## 🔧 OOP Concepts Used

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Class & Object** | Represent Book, Member, Transaction, Library |
| **Encapsulation** | Secures data with private variables |
| **Inheritance** | Used to create IssueRecord, ReturnRecord |
| **Polymorphism** | Function overriding in derived classes |
| **File Handling** | Persistent storage using `.txt` files |

## 🖥 Software & Hardware Requirements

### **Software**
- C++ (MinGW/g++)  
- VS Code / Code::Blocks / Turbo C++  
- Windows / Linux  

### **Hardware**
- Intel i3 or better  
- 4GB RAM  
- 100MB storage

## 🏁 Conclusion

The Library Management System provides a reliable, modular, and efficient solution for library operations.  
It successfully demonstrates key OOP concepts and real-world application of C++.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

- Practical understanding of OOP (classes, inheritance, encapsulation)  
- File handling using `fstream`  
- UML diagram creation  
- Debugging and compiler setup  
- Menu-driven C++ programming  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **C++ Programming Language**  
- **Object-Oriented Concepts (OOP)**  
- **File Handling**  
- **VS Code** (IDE)  
- **g++ (MinGW)** Compiler  
- **UML Class Diagrams**  
- **Text Files (.txt)** as a simple database  

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- VS Code: `g++` not recognized → fixed by updating system PATH  
- Syntax & indentation errors  
- Handling file operations safely  
- Managing incorrect user inputs
